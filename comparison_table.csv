Criteria,CAE (My Model),K-means Quantization,Justification
PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio),Moderate (26.09),Higher (31.97),Higher PSNR for K-means but lacks perceptual depth.
SSIM (Structural Similarity Index),High (0.856),Higher (0.956),CAE retains spatial and structural quality better.
Adaptivity to Complexity,Adaptive to region complexity,Uniform compression,CAE adjusts dynamically for diverse datasets.
Visual Quality of Complex Regions,Preserves essential details,Fails in detailed areas,CAE prioritizes perceptual importance over uniformity.
Flexibility and Scalability,Scalable across datasets,Manual tuning required,CAE scales easily to complex datasets.
Latent Space Representation,Learns reusable features,No latent representation,CAE's latent features enable extended applications.
Computational Efficiency,"Higher training cost, fast inference","Fast for small tasks, slow on scale",K-means struggles with computational demands on large tasks.
Reconstruction Error,Reduces significant reconstruction errors,Uniform errors,CAE reduces perceptually critical errors effectively.
Generalization,Reusable for various tasks,Limited to compression tasks,CAE generalizes better for broader image tasks.
Future Extensibility,Extendable to video or GANs,Static and less adaptable,CAE architecture allows advanced multimedia applications.
