Adaptive-Color-QuantizationImage compression is a critical challenge in digital image processing, especially as the demand for storage and transmission efficiency increases. Traditional color quantization methods often apply a fixed strategy, leading to poor quality retention in complex areas and underutilized potential in simpler regions. This project addresses these limitations by introducing an adaptive color quantization method using convolutional autoencoders. The aim of this project is to develop a model that dynamically adjusts color depth based on regional image complexity, ensuring efficient compression without compromising visual fidelity. This project makes use of the CIFAR-100 dataset to evaluate the proposed modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).
